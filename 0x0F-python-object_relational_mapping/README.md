#### Install and Activate Virtual Environment

To create a Python Virtual Environment, allowing you to install specific dependencies for this Python project, follow these steps:

1. Install venv:
    ```bash
    $ sudo apt-get install python3.8-venv
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment named 'venv':
    ```bash
    $ python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

Once activated, you can install project-specific dependencies within this virtual environment without affecting your system-wide Python installation.
